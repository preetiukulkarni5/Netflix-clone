# Netflix-clone

📄 HTML
HTML is used to build the structure of the Netflix clone, including the header, features section, FAQ, and footer. It organizes the content using semantic tags and links the CSS and JavaScript files.

🎨 CSS
CSS styles the entire page, making it look like the real Netflix site. It uses Flexbox, colors, fonts, and background images to create a clean, responsive design.

⚙️ JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity to the FAQ section by enabling expand/collapse functionality. It listens for user clicks and toggles content visibility.
